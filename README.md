This module is split over 5 weeks. Each week comprises an introductory lecture, workshop session and coursework submission

<ins>Topics:</ins> 
 * Week 11: Introduction; model fitting and selection
 * Week 12: Hypothesis testing, Bootstrapping and error propagation
 * Week 13: Sampling, distributions and Bayes theorem
 * Week 14: Clustering and classification algorithms 
 * Week 15: Machine learning techniques

<ins>Assessment:</ins>
 
Assessement for this module is through coursework alone. There are 4 submissions: 
 * Week 11 (due 4pm, 20th January) - 20%
 * Week 12 (due 4pm, 27th January) - 20%
 * Week 13 (due 4pm, 3rd February) - 20%
 * Week 14-15 (due 4pm, 24th February) - 40%

Each exercise will be placed online a week in advance. The workshops will introduce the topics of interest and are a great place to receive guidance on the exercices. 

Each submission requires three documents: 
 * A jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with replicable annotated code, that has already been run, and results (e.g. best-fit values and visualisations). 
 * A short _interpretative_ statement (.pdf, or a separate section of your .ipynb file) summarising what you have learned from the exercise.
    * This will be a maximum of 300 words, and *should* include one figure. 
    * This statement will make-up 25% of each assessment. 15% will also be available for good coding practices.
      * For the 15%, the first two exercies will focus on good coding practice, while the last two will focus on novel visualisations. 
    * Given that this is a 4th year module, _reasonable_ extra analysis _beyond_ that listed is expected. The results underpinning this analysis should be submitted as part of the jupyter-notebook.
    * The statement can comment on topic at hand or the results you have generated or your own reflections on the methodology being used. *GenAI tools cannot be used to generate this statement*. 
    * Do ask questions!
  * A completed "GenAI Usage" questionnaire. This is mandatory; non-submission will result in a penalty of 10%.
    * NB: GenAI can be used to write and optimise your code, along as you understand the working of the code. This module is an opportunity to understand how these libraries work _and_ how to use GenAI responsibly.
