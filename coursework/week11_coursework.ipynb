    " * Submit your work via Moodle.\n",
    " * You must submit a fully compiled `.ipynb` file which includes all codes required to replicate your results\n",
    "    * **Dont forget to check that every every cell runs before submitting**\n",
    "    * As part of the assessment your code will be run offline. \n",
    "    * You _must_ also respond to the mandatory GenAI self-assessment questionaire. \n",
    " * The estimated workload for this is 4-6 hours. \n",
    " \n",
    "### <font color='green'>Tips</font>\n",
    " * The last question of this exercise asks you write an interpretative statement.\n",
    "   * This assessment is designed to test your reflections on your learning and ability to summarise it succiently for a non-specialist audience. \n",
    "   * This question is worth 25% of the overall grade.\n",
    "      * To obtain this mark, additional work beyond the scope of the exercise is expected. All working must be included in the .ipynb submission.\n",
    "      * This additional work is at your own discretion. Any exploration of dataset beyond the scope of the worksheet presented is suitable.\n",
    "        * **NB**: the estimated workload for the entire worksheet is 4-6 hours.\n",
    "      * Markers have been asked to consider **both** additional work and insightful reflections.\n",
    "        * i.e. extensive work does not guarantee a high mark.\n",
    "   * The interpretative statement will be marked based on your reflections on your learning across the worksheet.\n",
    "      * It is expected to include both the values that you have found and an interpretation of it in the wider context.\n",
    "      * If you have not completed all exercises (or an extension) then the interpretative statement can focus on your learning:\n",
    "         * e.g. which techniques were difficult, and how might you address them.\n",
    " * 10% of marks are award for 'good coding practice'.\n",
    "   * A particular focus for this worksheet will be on annotations, such as doc-strings, comments and markdown notes.\n",
    "   * Pythonic coding is not expected, rather code that is accessible, and likely to be understandable **by you** after an extended break.\n",
    "   * Marks will be deducted for unnecessary steps (e.g. `for` loops) and inaccessible coding practices.\n",
    "   * Marks are also awarded for high quality visualisations, which be of extended focus later in the course.\n",
    "   * Explain all your reasoning for each step. Marks are given for explanations (in markup format) and discussion, as they evidence understanding of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='red'>WARNING</font>\n",
    " * This submission must be your own work. Please note the university's policy on plagiarism.\n",
    " * While it is acceptable (and indeed encouraged) to share ideas, you must ensure that you do not use other people's code or text, and that the reflections are your own.\n",
    " * It is acceptable to use GenAI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini) to produce code, but you must understand it. This module is an opportunity to learn key python libaries at the core of Data Science. Understanding these libaries now will enable you to use GenAI effectively when more advanced tasks are required.\n",
    " *  <font color='red'>**GenAI cannot be used to write the final interpretative statement**</font>\n",
    "   * Grammatical and syntax checks may be performed. \n",
    " * Should you use GenAI, then answer yes to the GenAI self-assessment. You will not be penalised for this. \n",
